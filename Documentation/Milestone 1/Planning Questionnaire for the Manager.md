# Planning Questionnaire for the Manager

## Project Manager: Alec Trievel

### Questions And Answers

* Have you got the commitment of the executive management for the project?
  * Yes. We will divide into 2 or 3 groups of 2 people each. Each of these groups will have their own responsiblities and an executive manager. The executive manager will report directly to me with updates, questions, or concerns. This effecitively removes the need to "micro manage" each group, which in turn alows the project to flow better
* Do all the executive managers know what they have to do?
  * Yes. All EMs have been assigned general tasks and weekly tasks they must complete
* Has agreement been reached on the resources needed?
  * Yes. All the hardware and software we need are either free or we already own it
* Have the key milestones been agreed?
  * Yes. We will follow the major milestones created by Dr. Chang in addition to weekly milestones
* Have the project plan been agreed by the executive management?
  * Yes. The plan has been agreed on by all memebrs of the group as well
* Are problems/solutions passed to the executive being promptly resolved?
  * Yes. Each EM will ateempt to file and solve the issues as they arise. If it is a serious issue, the PM and possibly entire group will be notified
* Does everyone on the project know what is expected of them?
  * 
* Do you know what tasks the company have to do?
  * 
* Do you know what the consultant will provide to the company?
  *
* Have you identified any inhibitors and ensured they are not on your team?
  * One of the largest inhibitors we discovered was that not all memembers have the same experience level or knowledge of certain aspects of a full stack application. These members will have to learn and read documentation on their own time. I expect them to learn, but I have no issues with holding small training sessions if needed
* Have you agreed how, and when, communication with the staff will be handled?
  * Yes. We will use Slack to communicate all information outside of meetings
* Have dates been set for steering group meetings? Are steering group meetings being held on schedule?
  * Yes. We will meet every Friday for at least 2 hours
* Will you make the target date?
  * While we cannot guarentee this since we did not start coding yet, I am confident we can reach the goal. The group seems to be cohesive, and we all seem to be motivated enough to make the project work.
