# Test Plan Steps #

## Step 1 - Create Tests ##

Create all the tests described in the documentation. If one of the test cases doesn't make sense or you think it can be improved, file an issue with the following details:

1. Title should be: [TEST ID] - Improvement
1. Body should be what you want to change
1. Assign me and yourself
1. Label it as `test plan`
1. Add to CodeFeed 2.0 Project

If you want to add a case, just make the title: Addition - [SUMMARY OF TEST]. Everything else will be the same

## Step 2 - Run Tests ##

Run the all the tests. If you find an defect, file the defect_report.md, and file a new issue with the fowllowing details:

1. Title should be a short summary of what the defect is
1. Body should be the defect_report.md
1. Assign me and yourself
1. Label it as `bug`
1. Add to CodeFeed 2.0 Project

## Step 3 - Re-run Test After Issue Fixed ##

You will need to run the test again once it is moved into the `To Test` group on GitHub. If it passes, move it to `Completed`. Otherwise, place it back in `To Do`. You will need to @ the person who attempted to fix the issue regardless if it passes or fails
